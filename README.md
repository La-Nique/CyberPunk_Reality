### Inspiration; Developer's words:

> Choose a place/destination (real or fictional) and create a React app to advertise it (attractions, restaurants, historical sites, etc...)

Valognan City was created inspired by Neon City from CyberPunk, the video game. 


#### Project Breakdown:

- [ ] Git workflow. Must use feature branch workflow and create pull requests before merging feature branches.
- [ ] Correctness of other tools used (ie should only be using React, React-Router, and vanilla CSS)
- [ ] User experience. How does it feel to use and navigate your website? Is the content presented to the user in a readable and useful manner? This includes colors, fonts, and backgrounds chosen.
- [ ] All content criteria are met:
    - [ ] There is a visually appealing homepage to greet the user and introduce the location chosen. 
    - [ ] There should be links to at least three other pages. 
    - [ ] Each of the three pages should have information regarding what someone who visits the location should/could do. 
    - [ ] For each page, please choose at least 2 subtopics. For example, a page on places to eat should feature at least two restaurants. 
    - [ ] Each subtopic should have a photo and a description.
